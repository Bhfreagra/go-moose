## Go-Moose (Status: in progress)

Go-Moose is a web application for image sharing and discovery.
For routing I used [Gin](https://gin-gonic.com/), a popular lightweight framework for web development in Go, which is very fast and offers middleware support.
As for the ORM, I used [gorm](https://gorm.io/) on a MySQL database. It's a really developer friendly ORM library for Go which I highly recommend

## Getting started

- Clone the repository
- Run the command `make`
- Then just run `go run go-moose`

or just go for the quicker way

- `makerun`

## Tests

To run the available tests just run `make test`
